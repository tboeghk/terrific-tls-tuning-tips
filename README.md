# Terrific TLS Tuning examples


## Preparations

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) 
1. Install Ansible: `brew install ansible`
1. Launch a Instance that is publicly available. The instance needs to use a `CentOS` flavoured 
   operating system like `CentOS` itself or Amazon Linux in EC2. Make sure you can ssh into the
   machine using your ssh key.
1. let a url of your choice point to the public IP of that instance. In our case this 
   is `wjax.terrific-tls-tuning-tips.com`.â€š

## Provisioning

1. Check connection: `ansible tls -m ping`
1. Provision a base system: `ansible-playbook ansible/01-base-system.yml`
